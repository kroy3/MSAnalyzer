# MSAnalyzer

This repository provides a set of Python scripts for parsing mass‑spectrometry ASCII
data files, converting them to structured CSV files, generating
publication‑quality plots, and offering a graphical user interface (GUI) to
facilitate these tasks. It is designed to simplify the workflow from raw
instrument data to analysis and visualization.

Features
ASCII parsing: Extracts data from mass‑spec files containing multiple
FUNCTION sections and writes each function’s scans and intensities to its
own CSV.

Plotting: Generates high‑resolution PNG plots of intensity vs. retention
time for each mass/charge (m/z) trace using Matplotlib, with sensible
defaults for publication quality.

GUI interface: Uses Tkinter to provide a tabbed application with three
distinct workspaces:

Load & Parse – Select raw ASCII files and an output directory,
automatically parse them into CSVs and plots, or import existing CSVs.

Plot & Customize – Choose a parsed function, select which m/z
traces to display, adjust figure size and DPI, and preview the resulting
figure directly in the app.

CSV Viewer – Open any CSV file (whether generated by the app or
external) and inspect its contents in a scrollable table.

Modular design: The code is organized to separate data parsing from
plotting and UI logic, making it straightforward to extend or integrate into
other projects.

Requirements
Ensure Python 3.8 or later is installed. The core dependencies are:

pandas – for tabular data handling

matplotlib – for plotting

Tkinter is included with most standard Python distributions. To install the
required libraries, run:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install pandas matplotlib
Usage
Basic GUI
The mass_spec_gui.py script provides a simple interface for parsing
ASCII files and generating CSVs and plots. Run it as follows:

bash
Copy
Edit
python mass_spec_gui.py
This launches a window where you can select one or more ASCII data files and
choose an output directory. Each FUNCTION in the selected files will be
saved as a CSV and a high‑resolution PNG plot in the chosen directory.

Advanced GUI
For a more feature‑rich experience, use mass_spec_gui_advanced.py:

bash
Copy
Edit
python mass_spec_gui_advanced.py
This advanced application introduces a tabbed interface with additional
functionality:

Load & Parse – Select ASCII files or previously saved CSVs and set
where outputs should be written. Parsed functions are listed for quick
reference.

Plot & Customize – Pick any loaded function, choose one or more m/z
values to visualize, and specify figure dimensions and resolution. The
resulting plot appears within the app.

CSV Viewer – Use the Open CSV File… button to load any CSV and view
its data in a scrollable table. This tab is independent of the parsed
data and accepts arbitrary CSV files.

CSV Files
CSV files produced by this application contain four columns: Scan,
Retention Time, m/z and Intensity. When loading CSVs back into the
advanced GUI, filenames that follow the pattern BaseName_Function_N.csv
will automatically be recognized and grouped by base name and function
number. The CSV viewer, however, allows you to open any CSV file.

Repository Structure
mass_spec_gui.py – Basic GUI for parsing ASCII files and plotting.

mass_spec_gui_advanced.py – Advanced GUI with tabbed interface and CSV viewer.

functions_csv/ – Example directory for storing parsed CSVs (empty by default).

plots/ – Example directory for storing generated plots (empty by default).

.gitignore – Files and directories ignored by git (see below).

requirements.txt – Python dependencies for the project.

Contributing
Contributions are welcome! Please open an issue or submit a pull request with
your improvements. Ideas for future enhancements include support for batch
processing via the command line, additional plotting options (e.g., log
scales), or integration with other mass‑spec data formats.
